## Java Naming conventions

By using standard Java naming conventions, you make your code easier to read for yourself and for other programmers. Readability of Java program is very important. It indicates that less time is spent to figure out what the code does. 

Java follows camelcase syntax for naming the class, interface, method and variable.

## Java Identifiers

All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called identifiers.

In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows âˆ’

+ All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).
+ After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.
+ A key word cannot be used as an identifier.
+ Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.

### Examples

**legal identifiers:**  `age`, `$salary`, `_value`, `__1_value`.

**illegal identifiers:**  `123abc`, `-salary`.
